## Name
DIT638 - Cyberfysiska system och system av system 
Group 4

## Description
This repository will be used for completing the assignments for DIT638

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## New features process 
* Create an issue that addresses a requirement and assign it to one of the engineers.
* Implement the solution on our local machines.
* Create a new branch with an appropriate and descriptive name and description.
* Create a merge request with the associated issue and await a review.
* After the review process is complete and the merge request gets approved, we merge. 

## Bug fixing process 
* Create an issue with a bug tag and assign it to a developer. 
* When the bug has been fixed, we create a new branch and create a merge request. 
* After the review process is complete and the merge request gets approved, we merge. 
* Once an issue is found by a developer in a committed branch, the bug tag is selected to be seen by the group. 

## Commit message structure 
* The contents of the title shall contain a descriptive and short summary of the main changes using the imperative form (ie. Add counter to the home page). The title should not be longer than 50 characters. 
* The body of said comment shall contain a simple but descriptive technical description of modified code such that the changes can be easily understood. It should also include a description of any smaller changes or modifications.
