# Code of Conduct

## How do we plan to collaborate?

- For code collaboration, the team uses GitLab. The Master branch is protected, each change is pushed to a separate branch then merged to the master if and only if integration is non-problematic
- All administrative work is done and communicated via Discord and/or meetings
-Although the team does not stick to a single style of development, reasonable parts of agile development methodologies like Scrum are to be adopted and used throughout the course.
- Meetings should roughly have the following structure:
    - Casual talk about non-work related stuff to get us warmed up
    - Present progress and done tasks
    - Difficulties faced and lessons learned
    - Group work
    - Next steps - task distribution
    - Plan for the next meeting

## How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?

- Use GitLab for version control so each team member can see what the others have done so far
- Track to-be-done tasks by creating GitLab issues. Each team member can 	“pull a task” (assign themselves) and close the issue once they are sure that the task is completely done
- Have “stand-up” sections in some of the meetings where team members present their work

---
## How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?

- Have a dedicated #resources text-channel on Discord where team members can share obtained knowledge (links to web articles etc.)
- Plan pair programming sessions 
- Let team member present their current progress on a task during meetings so everybody can have an idea of what is going on
Encourage members to ask questions for further clarifications

## What is our usual communication plan?

- ALL text-based communication is done in Discord
- There is no fixed number of meetings per week but we strive to average around 3 meetings a week
- To keep things flexible, at first, there won’t be fixed meeting times. This could of course change in later stages when we feel more mature about the project and get ourselves comfortable with others’ schedules
- Meetings are usually conducted in person. If at least one team member is not able to attend in person due to personal reasons, then the meeting is done online
- Meeting location and time is ALWAYS communicated and agreed on by EVERYONE
- Communication while pair programming is purely based on each pair’s preferences, although, if it’s online, it’s highly encouraged to be conducted in a visible environment such as in a voice-channel in the team’s Discord server so others are able to join if they wanted to

---
## How will we solve conflicts? 

- Conflicts regarding implementation such as architecture, design, coding approach, etc. are solved via voting. This comes in handy as the team consists of an uneven number of people. Note that, before the voting conflicting parties have the opportunity to share their views on the topic
- Conflicts regarding individuals are dealt with AS A TEAM. All members work on solving the problem during meetings as soon and as peacefully as possible. Only if the issue is quite severe or a solution consensus is not reached should the conflict be brought up to course responsible(s)
